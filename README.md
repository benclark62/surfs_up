# Surf's Up Challenge
Module 9

## Overview
### Purpose of the Analysis
Understanding that outdoor recreational activities and their ancillary supporting businesses are directly and significantly impacted by weather, investors are interested in quantifying historical weather patterns as a means to analyze the viability of a new location.  This analysis was conducted to understand the variance in temperature between summer and winter months.

## Results

#### June Summary Statistics

#### December Summary Statistics

#### Mean temperatures are consistent between June and December
- June mean temperature is only 3.9 degrees warmer than December, reflective of consistent tropical weather patterns
- Business implications are that outdoor activity would not vary greatly between seasons based on temperature changes
#### Temperatures during each month reflect similar consistency
- Both June and December temperatures had relatively low standard deviations (3.26 and 3.75, respectively), implying fairly predictable temperatures
- December's standard deviation is higher than June, but still fairly low
#### Bottom quartile of temperatures in December are below 70
- December's bottom quartile temperature (69) is four degrees lower than June (73)
- Impacts of this difference are unknown as further research is needed to understand the impact sub-70 temperature days on outdoor activities and store traffic

## Summary
### High-level summary and two additional 
Comparable temperatures between the two months bodes well for year-round business supporting outdoor activities.  While these two months presumably represent the seasonal extremes, a more comprehensive analysis would ensure that the tropical temperatures are actually experienced year-round.  Additional research could also include:
- 'Threshold' temperatures for outdoor activities; does dropping below a certain temperature reduce outdoor activity participation?
- Seasonal patterns in outdoor activities; does a slight change in average temperature translate to a shift to on-land activity compared to water sports?
- Combinatory effect of temperature and precipitation; investigate the compounding effects on outdoor activities of temperatures and precipitation (i.e., does the same increased precipitation level have a larger detrimental impact on outdoor activities at an average temperature of 65 than it does at 70?)
