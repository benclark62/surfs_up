#### Bottom quartile of temperatures in December are below 70
- Need to understand the impact sub-70 temperature days have on outdoor activities and store traffic

## Summary
### High-level summmary and two additional 
- Need to understand 'threshold' temperatures for outdoor activities
- Analyze seasonal patterns in outdoor activities 
- Conduct additional research on the compounding effects of temperatures and precipitation.
